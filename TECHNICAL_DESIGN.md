# Technical Design Document: Shopify Theme for "LiveSlowDieOld"

## Overview and Objectives

The project involves developing a **custom Shopify theme** for *LiveSlowDieOld*, a streetwear brand, by building on Shopify's Dawn theme as a foundation. The goal is to create a unique storefront inspired by the aesthetic and user experience of **LiveFastDieYoung (LFDY)**'s website, while adhering to Shopify's Polaris design system guidelines for consistent, high-quality UI components. This theme will support all standard e-commerce pages and features, with a focus on **responsive design**, **accessibility**, and integration with Shopify's GitHub version control workflow. Key objectives include:

* Designing a **custom layout** (not just Dawn's defaults) that captures the brand's streetwear vibe and improves user flow.
* Incorporating **Polaris design system** principles – leveraging Polaris UI patterns, design tokens (spacing, color, typography), and accessibility best practices – to ensure a clean, intuitive interface.
* Implementing **responsive layouts** optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints (following Shopify/Polaris guidelines for fluid grids and breakpoints).
* Providing all essential storefront pages: Home, Collections, Product Details, Cart, Checkout, Customer Account (login/register, account dashboard), Blog/News, Lookbook, About, Contact, FAQ, and legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Shipping, Returns). Each page will be tailored with custom templates or sections as needed.
* Adding **advanced e-commerce features**: product filtering by category/size/color/price, customer account management, product reviews integration, size guide modals, predictive search, and newsletter signup.
* Establishing a robust **GitHub integration and workflow** for theme development, following Shopify's official process. This includes using a Git repository for version control, connecting branches to the Shopify store for continuous deployment, and following best practices for branch management, code reviews, and theme updates.

This document outlines the technical design for the theme, covering the theme's file structure, templating approach, UI component strategy (with Polaris influences), responsive and accessible design techniques, advanced feature implementation, and the GitHub-based development workflow.

## Design System and UI Framework

**Polaris Design System Influence:** Although Polaris is primarily intended for Shopify's admin and apps, its design principles will guide the theme's UI for a consistent and user-friendly experience. We will use Polaris's **design tokens** and guidelines for spacing, layout, and interface components wherever applicable. For example, the Shopify Polaris system uses a **4px baseline grid for spacing** – our theme's CSS will adopt spacing in multiples of 4px to create a harmonious, rhythmic layout. Typography and color choices will be informed by Polaris tokens as well (adjusted to match *LiveSlowDieOld*'s branding), ensuring sufficient contrast and legibility in line with Polaris standards. We will also utilize Polaris' recommended breakpoints for responsive design (xs, sm, md, lg, xl) so that the layout adapts seamlessly across devices.

**UI Components and Patterns:** We plan to adapt common UI components in Dawn to follow Polaris-like patterns in styling and behavior:

* **Buttons and Forms:** All buttons (e.g. "Add to Cart", "Submit", etc.) will be styled similar to Polaris primary buttons – with clear states (hover, active, disabled), adequate padding, and a subtle border-radius for a modern look. Form elements will include proper labels, error messages, and helper text following Polaris form design guidelines.
* **Navigation and Menus:** The header navigation will include a mobile-friendly menu and a desktop menu with dropdowns for collections. We'll implement these with proper ARIA roles and states. The header will also feature search and cart icons using Polaris icons where possible.
* **Cards and Sections:** Content blocks will be structured in "card"-like containers similar to Polaris **Card components**, providing padding and separation. Product tiles in grids follow this pattern too.
* **Feedback and States:** We will implement status indicators and feedback messages in a Polaris-like style: for example, banners when adding an item to the cart or submitting a form.

**Polaris Accessibility & UX Considerations:** Polaris emphasizes accessibility and good UX practices. We'll ensure color contrast, keyboard navigation, and alt text for images. Where Polaris uses clear language, our theme's copy will be straightforward and on-brand.

**Visual Style and Inspiration:** The visual design will take cues from *LiveFastDieYoung.com*'s layout and vibe – bold imagery, clean typography, and a modern minimalist aesthetic to highlight products. We'll ensure colors are used consistently and meet contrast requirements.

## Theme Architecture and File Structure

The theme will follow Shopify's **Online Store 2.0** architecture with these main folders:

* **layout** – contains `theme.liquid` as the base wrapper.
* **templates** – holds page templates, mostly JSON templates defining sections.
* **sections** – modular sections that can be reused across templates; we'll create custom sections for hero banners, lookbook galleries, FAQs, etc.
* **snippets** – reusable Liquid snippets for components like review stars or size guides.
* **assets** – final compiled stylesheets and scripts along with images.
* **config** – theme settings defined in `settings_schema.json` and `settings_data.json`.
* **locales** – translation files for internationalization (starting with `en.default.json`).

This structure keeps the theme modular and maintainable. Sections and blocks will let the merchant rearrange content through the Theme Editor.

## Page Templates and Layout Design

### Home Page

The homepage will use a configurable `index.json` template with sections for a hero banner, featured collections, brand story, lookbook preview, blog teaser, and newsletter signup. Each section can be reordered or removed via the Theme Editor. We'll ensure the layout is responsive and images use lazy loading for performance.

### Collection & Search Results

Collection pages will provide product filtering using Shopify's storefront filtering system. Filters appear in a sidebar on desktop and in a slide-out panel on mobile. Product grids adapt from 4 columns on large screens down to 1 column on small. Search results will share this layout. Pagination or a "Load more" button will manage large lists.

### Product Detail Page

The product page will feature a media gallery, product information, variant pickers, a prominent add-to-cart button, dynamic checkout buttons, reviews, a size guide modal, and a related-products section. Variant selection will update images and prices dynamically. The size guide will be powered by a Liquid snippet with accessible modal behavior.

### Cart and Checkout

We'll retain Dawn's AJAX cart drawer for quick access and a full cart page for users without JavaScript. Checkout customization is limited unless Shopify Plus is used; we'll ensure branding via the theme settings.

### Customer Account Pages

Login, register, account overview, addresses, and order pages will be styled consistently. Forms will use accessible labels and error handling.

### Blog and Lookbook

Blog index and article templates will present content cleanly with responsive images. The Lookbook page will showcase a gallery of curated images linking to products or collections.

### Content Pages

Pages like About, Contact, and FAQ will use custom sections for flexible layouts. The FAQ will include accessible accordion-style questions and answers.

## Advanced Functionalities & Integrations

* **Storefront filtering** for collections and search.
* **Product reviews** via a Shopify app, displayed on product pages.
* **Newsletter signup** forms that submit to Shopify's customer list, with optional AJAX for confirmation.
* **Predictive search** using Shopify's predictive search API.
* **Performance optimization** by lazy loading images and deferring non-critical scripts.
* **Accessibility enhancements** like skip links, ARIA labels, and focus management.
* **Third-party integrations** (analytics, chat widgets) supported through `content_for_header` and `content_for_footer` hooks.

## Front-End Development Approach

We will organize CSS using a preprocessor (SCSS) compiled to a single stylesheet and follow Polaris design tokens for spacing and color. JavaScript will be modular ES6 bundled into minimal files. Liquid templates will stay lean, relying on sections and snippets for logic. We'll progressively enhance features so the store remains functional without JavaScript.

## GitHub Integration and Workflow

A private GitHub repository will store the theme code. We will connect branches to the Shopify store using Shopify's GitHub integration for continuous deployment. Development occurs on a `dev` branch synced to an unpublished theme, while `main` is reserved for production-ready code. Pull requests and code reviews ensure quality. Version tags mark significant releases and rollback is as simple as reverting a commit.

## Accessibility and Responsive Design

We will meet WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines with semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes where needed, sufficient color contrast, and alt text. The design is mobile-first with breakpoints aligned to Polaris guidelines, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

## Conclusion

By combining Shopify's Dawn foundation with Polaris design principles, this theme will deliver a polished storefront for *LiveSlowDieOld*. Advanced features like filtering, reviews, and predictive search enhance usability, while GitHub integration ensures maintainable development. The result is a fast, responsive, and accessible shopping experience tailored to the brand's streetwear aesthetic.
